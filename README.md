Tic Tac Toe is traditionally played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid. Players take turns placing a mark in one of the cells of the grid. The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game.
